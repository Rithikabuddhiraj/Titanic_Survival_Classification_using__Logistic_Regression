# 🚢 Titanic Survival Classification using Logistic Regression

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, and more.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a **binary classification model** that predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `titanic.csv` – Cleaned Titanic dataset with relevant features.
- `Titanic_Logistic_Regression_Model.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data loading and exploration
  - Data preprocessing
  - Logistic Regression model training
  - Model evaluation and accuracy checking
  - Insights and conclusions

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy – Data analysis and manipulation
- Seaborn & Matplotlib – Data visualization
- Scikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluation

---

## 📊 Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a **supervised learning algorithm** used for **binary classification problems**.  
It estimates the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class.

In this project:
- Input: Passenger details (like Age, Pclass, Sex, etc.)
- Output: 0 (Not Survived) or 1 (Survived)

---

## ✅ Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1 Score)**

---

## 📈 Insights

- Women had a higher survival rate than men.
- Passengers in higher classes (1st Class) had a better chance of survival.
- Younger passengers had better survival probabilities.
